🔳 The Boundary Cancellation Principle (BCP)


A Discovery Engine for Arithmetic Lattice Residues & Riemann Hypothesis Connections

🚀 Overview
The Boundary Cancellation Principle is a unique mathematical framework that redefines how we calculate and interpret the density of coprime k-tuples in integer lattices. While traditional number theory focuses on the asymptotic density (1/\zeta(k)), this engine focuses on the deterministic residue \Delta(R)—the error that exists at any finite search radius R.

The Core Discovery
The BCP identifies that the error term \Delta(R) is not stochastic noise. Instead, it is a deterministic geometric residue localized at the (k-1) boundary shell where the Möbius inversion engine is truncated.

🔬 Unique Features vs. Traditional Methods
| Feature | Traditional Methods | Boundary Cancellation Principle |
|---|---|---|
| Error Origin | Global arithmetic discrepancy | Localized Boundary Truncation |
| Perspective | Stochastic / Noise-based | Deterministic / Wave-based |
| Scaling | Computationally Expensive (O(R)) | Asymptotic / Geometric Scaling |
| RH Link | Growth-rate bounds | Incomplete Cancellation Cycles |

📐 Mathematical Foundation
The engine uses the exact summatory function to map residues:
The Boundary Residue is then isolated:
By analyzing \Delta(R) across dimensions, the engine demonstrates Dimensional Stability: as k increases, the relative error decreases, proving that the residue is a surface-area effect rather than a volume effect.

🛠 Features
 * 2D/3D Coprime Lattice Visualizer: Real-time rendering of k-dimensional structures with GCD inspection.
 * Möbius Wave Analysis: Visualizes the cumulative sum of \mu(d) to show how cancellation cycles fail at the boundary.
 * Error Exponent Hunter: Calculates the growth exponent \alpha in \Delta(R) \propto R^\alpha to test Riemann Hypothesis predictions.
 * Infinite Scaling Predictor: A heuristic model that bypasses O(R) computation to predict residues at astronomical scales.
 * Research Console: High-precision arithmetic (50+ digits) for verifying critical strip projections.
📈 The Riemann Hypothesis Connection
The structure of \Delta(R) is governed by the oscillations of the Möbius function \mu(n). Because the BCP maps these oscillations as a geometric truncation, it provides a unique "Glass Box" view of the Mertens Function M(x). The engine demonstrates that the "randomness" of primes is actually a structural byproduct of wave interference at the lattice boundary.
